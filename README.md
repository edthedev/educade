## The Games

### Sandwich Panic!

A clone of "Peanut Butter Panic", lovingly updated for four players.

Peanut Butter Panic! was easily one of my favorite games for the good old Commordore 64.
It was a part of my inspiration to become a programmer.
This four player tribute is presented along with
full open source code in the hopes of inspiring at least a few smiles and maybe a few careers.


### About Peanut Butter Panic

Peanut Butter Panic for the Commodore 64 was created by the CTW Software Group - a US software development group, part of Children's Computer Workshop, Inc.

They mainly developed educational games and software based on the Sesame Street license. So technically, **Nutniks ought to count as muppets**. There's probably little hope that "Muppets Now!" will rediscover these little guys that were a big part of my childhood - but I can dream.

My eternal thanks to the **CTW Software Group Development Team for Peanut Butter Panic:**

Harold Byrd, Dick Codor, Sandy Damashek, Bernie De Koven,
Lisa Feder, Laura Kurland, Dan Oehlsen, Mary Schenck Balcer, Alan Shapiro, Debra Weinberger

Your work continues to inspire me.

### The Original Welcome Message from Peanut Butter Panic

```
* * * * * * * * * * * * * 
    Welcome Nutniks!
* * * * * * * * * * * * * 

Your goal is to make 
as many sandwiches as 
you can by catching
stars to power your
sandwich machine.
```
