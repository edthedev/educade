# EduCade Repository - Games

This repository contains scripts (mostly Ansible) to maintain my school lab computers and custom arcade machiens.

In general, these solutions assume the school machines are Raspberry Pi, Orange Pi or LibreComputer hardware, and are running the "Armbian" operating system. Variants of Armbian such as RetroPie and Raspbian will typically work fine.

It also contains a few games I wrote in Python.
