# tmntcade
Source files to add open source games to a RetroPi

## My paths

On the RetroPi run:
```
sudo apt-get install python-pygame
```

Copy everything in joytest to:

```
\\tmntcade\roms\ports\joytest
```

Use the 'Ports' Menu to add joytest.sh to the ports games list.
Restart EmulationStation.
